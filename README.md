## *Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project Cousera*

This repo storages the Coursera's Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The source of the raw data is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. This Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 subjects were performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
